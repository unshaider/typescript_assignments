// 7. Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results. 
// 8. You should create four lines that look like this:
// _____________________________________________
// console.log(5 + 3)
// _____________________________________________
// Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.
console.log(3 + 5);
console.log(10 - 2);
console.log(4 * 2);
console.log(24 / 3);
