// 45. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature.  Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

interface CarInfo {
    manufacturer: string;
    model: string;
    [key: string]: any;
}

function createCar(manufacturer: string, model: string, ...options: [string, any][]): CarInfo {
    const car: CarInfo = {
        manufacturer,
        model
    };

    options.forEach(([key, value]) => {
        car[key] = value;
    });

    return car;
}

console.log(createCar("Honda", "Civic", ["color", "Black"], ["year", 2024]));
console.log(createCar("Toyota", "Supra", ["color", "red"], ["sunroof", true]));
